<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is my own attempt at becoming comfortable with the Valorant Client API, and keeping track of my performance as I play Valorant.


### Built With

* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Electron.js](https://www.electronjs.org/)
* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/)
* [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
* [valclient](https://github.com/colinhartigan/valclient.py)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This project is built mainly through ReactJS and Python, requiring `npm 8.x.x+` and `Python 3.7.x+`

### Usage

**Valorant must be open and running in the background for the Flask API to receive match data**

To run the Electron App, cd into `val_app` and run
* npm

  ```sh
  npm install
  npm run electron-dev
  ```
To start the Flask API, at the root directory run
* python

  ```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  python ./api.py
  ````
To generate a distributable executable, cd into `val_app` and run
```sh
npm run electron-pack
```
Then, navigate to `val_app/dist` and run  `val_app Setup 0.1.0.exe` to install
